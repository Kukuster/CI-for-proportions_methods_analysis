# CI methods efficacy analysis toolkit
Measures efficacy of methods for calculating confidence interval.
Currently provides with a toolking for measuring efficacy of methods for confidence interval for the following statistics:

 - proportion
 - difference between two proportions

An inspiraton for the library:

## PLAN (TODOs)

### **_V_ 1. Refactor main function**
Both implementations of calculating coverage (`calculate_coverage_randomly` and `calculate_coverage_analytically`) in both toolkits (`CI_method_for_proportion_efficacy` and `CI_method_for_diff_betw_two_proportions_efficacy`) have way too much in common. Gonna DRY out a lot of code. Won't be easy though.

### **_V_ 2. Improve `proportions` interface**
Proportions are passed to these functions in a wierd way.
Let proportions be passed to functions as either `List[str]`, `List[float]` or `Tuple[str,str,str]`

### **_V_ 3. Improve automatic precision of analytical solution**
`z_precision` should slightly increase with increasing `confidence`. It's been shown that simply making `z_precision` to correspond to `p_precision` that equals to a number 1000 times closer to 1 than `confidence` doesn't quite nail it. It does for lower `confidence`, but with confidence 99.99% and more, `z_precision` maybe should increase even more. It turns out, for `confidence = 99.99%` having `z_precision = 99.999_99%` is good, but for `99.999_943%` having `z_precision = 99.999_999_943%` isn't enough.

### **4. Tidy up & publish**
 - remove all imports of whole libraries, leave only imports of necessary parts (i guess this is the right way to do it)
 - prepare structure to publish as a package
 - publish as `pip` package

### **Also:**
see `BACKLOG.md`



## NOTES

### Methods for measuring efficacy of CI methods
Two ways can be used to calculate efficacy of CI methods:
 - approximately, with random simulation (as implemented in R by Dr. Dennis Robert, see link above)
 - precisely, with the analytical solution

Both methods are implemented here for CI for both statistics: *proportion*, and *difference between two proportions*. For precise analyticsl solution a potentially lossy optimization has been made. It's regulated with parameter `z_precision` which is by default calculated automatically and it has its drawbacks (see PLAN section).


### Figuring out how to use certain advanced methods for calculating CI for the *difference between two proportions*

Start with this document:

**[https://ncss-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/ncss/pdf/Procedures/PASS/Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Difference_Between_Two_Proportions.pdf](https://ncss-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/ncss/pdf/Procedures/PASS/Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Difference_Between_Two_Proportions.pdf) **

Figure out how exaclty to implement the methods and evaluate their efficacy.

E.g. as I understood  the **Farrington and Manningâ€™s Score** method, the main idea is to calculate 2 values for delta0, that is the confidence interval for the delta (which equals to p1_hat - p2_hat)

For this, we calculate everything and get zFMD = F(delta0), where F is some sick humongous function over the unknown variable - delta0. It involves polynomials of delta0 up to 4th power, cosines and arccosines of that, and a square root over all that. Then the the delta0 is calculated as a solution for zFMD = F(delta0) for zFMD equals +-z-score for the given alpha. It's very likely that it is impossible to solve this analytically (hence such a recipe). Therefore, I have to figure out a way to implement numerical methods for solving this in general form.

By the way, I think "MLE" there means "Maximum Likelihood Estimate", but I'm not sure.
