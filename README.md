## PLAN (2021.03.29)

### Plottting

To figure out the best method for calculating _**CI for the difference between two proportions**_, I have to make one more simulation and plot it as a 2d-histogram:

https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist2d.html

The idea is that I would have a `dark_background` style, with a gradient colors. e.g. for a 95%CI:
 - 95% coverage - white color,
 - 50% coverage - red color,
 - 100% - green or blue


### Simulating methods

Start with this document:

**[https://ncss-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/ncss/pdf/Procedures/PASS/Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Difference_Between_Two_Proportions.pdf](https://ncss-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/ncss/pdf/Procedures/PASS/Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Difference_Between_Two_Proportions.pdf) **

Figure out how exaclty to implement the methods and evaluate their efficacy.

E.g. as I understood  the **Farrington and Manningâ€™s Score** method, the main idea is to calculate 2 values for delta0, that is the confidence interval for the delta (which equals to p1_hat - p2_hat)

For this, we calculate everything and get zFMD = F(delta0), where F is some sick humongous function over the unknown variable - delta0. It involves polynomials of delta0 up to 4th power, cosines and arccosines of that, and a square root over all that. Then the the delta0 is calculated as a solution for zFMD = F(delta0) for zFMD equals +-z-score for the given alpha. It's very likely that it is impossible to solve this analytically (hence such a recipe). Therefore, I have to figure out a way to implement numerical methods for solving this in general form.

By the way, I think "MLE" there means "Maximum Likelihood Estimate", but I'm not sure.
